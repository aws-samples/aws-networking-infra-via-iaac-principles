## How to use Infrastructure as Code principles to deploy and manage AWS networking environment

This repository contains supporting file for the blog <will replace this with final blog post link>. This blog will demonstrate how to create a networking stack on AWS using AWS CloudFormation and manage it via IaC concepts and tools. In this blog we will create a pipeline using AWS CodeCommit and AWS CodePipeline services. Once we have created the pipeline and other required constructs to manage the infrastructure as code, we will add an Amazon Managed Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Endpoints, VPC peering and AWS Transit Gateway. We will do this by modifying the code instead of making changes from AWS web console.
